### Setup developer environment

Set up local python environment:

This service uses python 3.8. If you do not have python 3.8 on your computer we can recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) in order to install and use it.
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pip-tools
pip install black
```

Install node packages and set up build environment:
```
make init
```

### Add new python packages to build environment:

To install new python packages add it to `setup.py => install_requires` then run `pip-compile` => `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Tests

Tests are run using [tox](https://pypi.org/project/tox/)

To run test with our python build environment: `make test`

To run auto format: `make format` 

For tests and linting we use [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/),
[flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) and
[black](https://pypi.org/project/black/).


## Deploy

`make deploy`
